                     System Planning Toolbox

The System Planning Toolbox performs the engineering analysis required
for the coordination of communication networks under national and
international regulatory criteria with a focus on the
Radiocommunication Sector Space Services.

The System Planning Toolbox is implemented in MATLAB, and as such, a
license for MATLAB is required to use the toolbox. No other toolboxes
provided by The Mathworks are, however, required for calculating
equivalent power flux density (EPFD) up, down, and inter-satellite for
comparison with Article 22 limits.

Toolbox and relevant ITU documentation can be found in the "doc"
directory, and an example simulation script can be found in the
"src/matlab/com/springbok/simulation/+example" directory.

To use the package, unzip the archive, then in MATLAB, navigate to the
resulting directory and add the toolbox to the MATLAB search path:

>> addpath(genpath(‘src/matlab’);

Run the example simulation and plot the results:

>> simulate_gso_leo.Simulate;
>> simulate_gso_leo.Plot;

Run the tests in a directory:

>> TestUtility.testDir('src/matlab/com/springbok/antenna');

For help using MATLAB, The Mathworks provides excellent online
documentation at: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html.

coordination services, or representation before national and
international regulatory entities, contact Roger LeClair at
